# Astrobot

More complex version from the * [Very simple Ruby Gem](https://github.com/dsander/transmission-client) to comunicate with the Transmission API.

There are other alternatives, this one just works better for me but I recommend you to check out the others.:

* [Transmission Client](https://github.com/dsander/transmission-client)
* [Transmission Connector](https://github.com/mattissf/transmission-connector)


## Installation

Add this line to your application"s Gemfile:

    gem "astrobot"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install astrobot

      Astrobot.configure(
        :username => "username",
